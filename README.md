This is a toolkit that the [Dedham Food
Pantry](https://www.dedhamfoodpantry.org) uses to monitor our
signupgenius signups.

* `trustee-available` uses the SUG API to check our Trustee signup sheet and list any dates that don't have a trustee on duty.
* `sugwatch` is a WIP scraper. Probably not useful.
